2011. Final Value of Variable After Performing Operations.
Easy
There is a programming language with only four operations and one variable X:

++X and X++ increments the value of the variable X by 1.
--X and X-- decrements the value of the variable X by 1.
Initially, the value of X is 0.

Given an array of strings operations containing a list of operations, return the final value of X after performing all the operations.
solution
class Solution {
public:
    int finalValueAfterOperations(vector<string>& operations) {
        int X=0;
        for(int i=0;i<operations.size();i++){
            if(operations[i] == "X++"||operations[i] == "++X"){
                ++X;
            }
            else{
                --X;
            }
        }
        return X;
    }
};
